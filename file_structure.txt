Essential Files:

app.py (or main.py): This remains your main application file.

    Purpose:
    Initializes the Flask application.
    Loads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame once when the application starts.
    Defines the Flask routes (@app.route).
    Starts the Flask development server.

routes.py (or views.py): This file handles your application's logic for different URLs (routes).

    Purpose:
    Contains the functions that are executed when a user visits a specific URL on your website.
    Manages incoming HTTP requests, accesses the in-memory Pandas DataFrame, and passes data to the template files.
    Routes for homepage (ingredient input), recommendations, and potential details page will be defined here.

recommendation.py (or recommender.py): This file contains the logic for the recommendation engine.

    Purpose:
    Houses the functions and algorithms for processing user input ingredients and filtering/ranking recipes from the Pandas DataFrame.
    Should be focused on data manipulation with the DataFrame.
    Potentially Separate Files (Depending on Complexity):

utils.py (or helpers.py): This file can contain utility functions used across different parts of the application.

    Purpose:
    Functions for tasks like:
    Parsing the ingredient strings.
    Data cleaning and preprocessing.
    Any other reusable logic that doesn't fit neatly into the other files.

forms.py: (Optional) If you are still using Flask-WTF or a similar library for web forms.



Frontend Files (Not Python, but essential):

HTML Templates (e.g., in a templates folder):

index.html (homepage with ingredient input).

recommendations.html (displaying recommended recipes).

(Optional) recipe_detail.html.


Static Files (e.g., in a static folder):

style.css (for styling your website).

script.js (for any client-side JavaScript).
